# Odin Recipes

This is a simple recipe website built as part of the Foundations course from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to practice basic HTML structure, including:

- Using proper tags (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Creating lists and links
- Structuring content across multiple pages

## Skills Demonstrated

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated:

- Creating multi-page websites using HTML
- Linking between pages
- Using semantic tags for better readability and accessibility
